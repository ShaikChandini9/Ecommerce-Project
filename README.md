# üõçÔ∏è E-Commerce Backend ‚Äì Spring Boot REST API

**A modern, scalable, and production-ready backend for a complete e-commerce platform.**  
Built using **Spring Boot**, this backend provides a set of **clean, secure, and well-structured APIs** for managing everything from **products, orders, and payments** to **wishlists, reviews, and customers**.

This project is designed to **power real-world e-commerce solutions**, whether it‚Äôs a web platform or a mobile shopping app, with a strong focus on **data integrity**, **transaction management**, and **maintainable code architecture**.

---

## üöÄ Why This Project Stands Out

Building an e-commerce system is challenging due to its **complex relationships** and **business rules**. This project demonstrates how to tackle these challenges by implementing:

- **Proper database relationships** with `OneToOne`, `OneToMany`, `ManyToOne`, and `ManyToMany`.
- **Transactional safety** to ensure data consistency.
- **Scalable and modular design**, making it easy to add new features.
- **Cascading and orphan removal** for automatic cleanup of related data.
- **Realistic workflows**, such as moving items from a wishlist to an order and handling payments.

> It‚Äôs not just another CRUD project ‚Äî this backend mimics **real-world e-commerce scenarios**.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### **1. Product Management**
- Create, update, view, and delete products.
- Maintain accurate **inventory and stock levels**.
- Validate before deleting products:
  - Prevent deletion if the product is part of an **active order**.
  - Automatically delete related **wishlist items** and **reviews**.
  
> Ensures no dangling references or broken data relationships.

---

### **2. Customer Management**
- Full customer profiles with relationships to:
  - Orders
  - Wishlists
  - Reviews
- Clean deletion logic:
  - When a customer is deleted, their **reviews**, **wishlist items**, and **pending orders** are handled properly.

---

### **3. Wishlist Feature**
- Add or remove products from a wishlist.
- **Move products from wishlist directly to orders**:
  - Automatically reduces product stock.
  - Removes the item from the wishlist.
  - Creates a new order with **PENDING_PAYMENT** status.

> Provides a seamless ‚ÄúAdd to Cart ‚Üí Checkout‚Äù backend workflow.

---

### **4. Order Management**
- Create orders with **multiple items**.
- Automatically decrease product stock on order placement.
- Track order status through the entire lifecycle:
  ```
  PENDING_PAYMENT ‚Üí PROCESSING ‚Üí PAID ‚Üí COMPLETED
  ```
- Built-in validations to prevent invalid operations such as paying for canceled orders.

---

### **5. Payment System**
- Securely process payments with unique **auto-generated confirmation codes** (e.g., `CONF-AB12CD34`).
- Support multiple payment modes such as **CREDIT_CARD** or **DEBIT_CARD**.
- Enforce a strict **one-to-one relationship between orders and payments**.
- Payment status tracking:
  - INITIATED
  - CONFIRMED
  - FAILED

---

### **6. Product Reviews**
- Customers can leave **only one review per product**.
- Reviews include:
  - **Rating** (1‚Äì5 stars)
  - **Title and detailed comments**
  - Automatic timestamp
- Automatically deleted if the associated **product** or **customer** is removed.

> Database-enforced uniqueness on `(customer_id, product_id)`.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

This backend uses a **relational database** with clean, normalized tables and strong referential integrity.

```
Customer 1---* Wishlist *---1 Product
Customer 1---* Review   *---1 Product
Customer 1---* Order
Order    1---* OrderItem *---1 Product
Order    1---1 Payment
```

### **Key Tables:**
- **customers** ‚Äì Stores customer details  
- **products** ‚Äì All product-related data  
- **wishlists** ‚Äì Tracks products customers are interested in  
- **orders** ‚Äì Main order records  
- **order_items** ‚Äì Line items for each order  
- **payments** ‚Äì Payment details per order  
- **reviews** ‚Äì Customer reviews per product
